one part: exercises (one sphinx page per ...)

Ideas for chapters:

1) intro
2) forall and or etc
3) functions (inj of inj is inj)
4) basic ring stuff [enough to solve 37a=m-n ->37(-a)=n-m etc]
5) Equiv relns. Easy stuff: a~b and c~b and c~d -> a~d.  euclidean + reflexive iff equiv reln. Equiv relns = partitions. Cong mod 37 is an equiv reln -- needs ring stuff. Lagrange theorem! Is that hard?
6) Make complex numbers.
7) Make top spaces or something
