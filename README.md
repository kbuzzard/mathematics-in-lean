# mathematics-in-lean
Learning material for mathematicians who want to learn Lean

### What is here?

Not much. There is an website [here](http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/lean_together/source/leantogether.html) which is more useful for a complete beginner.

In `src/Exercises` there are some basic exercises. Explanations of how to attempt them are on the website.

### What are future plans?

More exercises!
