# mathematics-in-lean
Learning material for mathematicians who want to learn Lean

### What is here?

Over the next few days I will add some exercises in basic logic and mathematics.

### What are future plans?

I would like to document some basic tactics here, and also document constructors and eliminators for basic types.
